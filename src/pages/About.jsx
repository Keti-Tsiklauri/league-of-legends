      <p>
        <strong>League of Legends</strong> (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle

      <h3 className="mt-4">History & Creation</h3>
      <p>
        League of Legends was created by Riot Games, founded by Brandon Beck and
        Marc Merrill in 2006. The game was inspired by the Warcraft III mod
        “Defense of the Ancients (DotA)” and was designed to provide a
        competitive, team-based experience that is easy to pick up but hard to
        master.

        Players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities, and work
        in teams to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, the core building located
        in their base. League of Legends features regular updates, ranked modes,
        seasonal events, and a vast roster of over 160 champions, each with
        their own lore and abilities.
